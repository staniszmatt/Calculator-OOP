## My Calculator in OOP
1. Work on the scope defined <a href="https://github.com/staniszmatt/Calculator-OOP">Below</a>
1. Pulled original calculator and first commit in this repository to start setup in OOP

## Scope
 - Imported a bad version of the calculator and will setup with all fixes in OOP.
      - **Parameters**
          - `num1` - first number used in a calculation
          - `num2` - second number used in a calculation
          - `operator` - operator that will determine what type of calculation will be made
      - This function will be used to handle the basic calculations once two numbers and an operator have been registered
  - Add click handlers to all buttons in the DOM. When clicked a function will be called that will do the following:
      - Numbers `(0-9)` will be stored in an array, concatenating with previous numbers if appropriate,and be displayed on the DOM
      - Operators `(+, -, *, /)` will be stored in an array and be displayed on the DOM
      - Equal `(=)` will call the function that will perform the calculation of the given expression
  - Take the value and display in the correct layout area within the DOM
      - The display of the calculation will be up to each students interpretation of how a calculator should look. **If you need ideas
      look at your calculator on your phone.**
